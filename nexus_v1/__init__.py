"""NEXUS v1 — Phase 1 difficulty-based routing (Admin → Intern/Director/CEO).

This is the original NEXUS architecture where a central AdminAgent classifies
request difficulty and routes to tiered LLM agents. Superseded by AgentOffice
(agentoffice/) which implements a full company hierarchy with contracts.

Kept for reference and potential reuse of the LiteLLM model router.
